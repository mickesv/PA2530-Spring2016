# Prerequisites
- You have [Created an Architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectArchitecture/exp_architecture.html) for your project.
- You have [Created a Deployment Plan]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectArchitecture/exp_deploymentplan.html) for your project.
- You have [Created a Test Plan]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectImplementation/exp_testplan.html) for your project.

# Implement
Implement your project according to your architecture.

If the time estimates you of course have made for your project indicate that it is too large to fit within the time frame, then select a reasonable subset of features to develop. Select this subset such that you still span as much as possible of your cloud deployment architecture. Motivate your selection and negotiate it with the course manager.

# Test Often
Use your development and test deployment environments to test the project according to your test plans. Run the automated tests often, and the manual tests regularly.

You may wish to consider continuous integration sytems to help you with your tests. For example:

- [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/getting_started) is available online for open source projects.
- [Jenkins CI](http://jenkins-ci.org/) requires you to install it, but is more often used by industry.
