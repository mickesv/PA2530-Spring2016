# Identify Relevant System Tests
Identify the tests that you consider critical for your project. These may include tests of functionality, but also of the architecture relevant requirements identified as you were creating your architecture.

You shall also pay particular attention to the cloud-specific requirements on e.g. scalability and reliability.

# Describe a Test Plan
Describe how you plan on testing your project with respect to the tests identified above.

# Automate System Tests
Automate as much as possible of your tests. Use test frameworks where applicable, script the parts that can be scripted and write test manuscripts for the parts that cannot.
