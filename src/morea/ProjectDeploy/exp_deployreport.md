# Reflective Report
Summarise your experiences from deploying your cloud application in a report (2--5 pages). Your report shall at least contain the following (described further below):

- Challenges
- Quality Attributes
- Continuous Monitoring


## Challenges
Describe the major challenges when developing, testing, and deploying your cloud application. What were their causes? What could you have done to mitigate them? How would they influence your cloud application if you were to continue developing it with a larger development teams?

## Quality Attributes
Measure (if possible) or assess your performance with respect to your most important quality attributes (for example, reliability, scalability, security, privacy, and efficiency). Do you meet your expectations? If not, why not? What can you do to improve your performance?

## Continuous Monitoring
How can you keep track of the health of your cloud application and the machines it is running on? Explore different tools and techniques and weigh the benefits and liabilities of each against each other.
