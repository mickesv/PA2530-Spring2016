You are done with this module when you have:

- An understanding of what provisioning is, and the need for it.
- A shallow understanding of some of the more common provisioning tools.
- Provisioned a Vagrant box using the built-in mechanisms to install (at least) curl, git, and node.js.
- Provisioned a Vagrant box using Puppet to install (at least) curl and node.js

### Checkpoint
When you have done the above, book a time with a lab assistant. Be prepared to answer questions about provisioning. Also, be prepared to start up your Vagrant box and show your Puppet manifest.
