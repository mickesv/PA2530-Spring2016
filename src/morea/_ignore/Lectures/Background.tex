\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Background}
Historically, as hardware requirements grew companies would:
\begin{itemize}
\item Host their own servers and pay for network access
\item Outsource to an IT service provider
\end{itemize}

Challenges with this:
\begin{itemize}
\item Expensive
\item Not Elastic (Contractually fixed service levels)
\item High entry barriers
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Cloud Computing}
Characteristica that identifies a cloud service:
\begin{itemize}
\item Offered by a third party
\item Available when needed
\item Dynamically scalable
\item Low initial investment to get started
\item Pay for what you use, when you use it
\item Easily accessible
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Five Main Principles}
\begin{itemize}
\item Pooled Computing Resources
\item Virtualised Computing Resources
\item Elastic Scaling up or down as needed
\item Automated creation/deletion of virtual machines
\item Resource usage billed only as used.
\end{itemize}

\pause
\ldots
\begin{itemize}
\item Note that \emph{most} of these are oriented towards the underlying technology.
\item Together, they enable a cloud provider to offer the service at a lower cost than for a company to host the servers themselves.
\item Ends up in the ability to offer the last bullet.
\item Network?
\item Access API
\item Storage + Databases
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Cloud Benefits}

\begin{itemize}
\item Lower Initial barrier: Capital expenses $\rightarrow$ Operational expenses
\item Responsiveness: You do not have to wait for procurement of new servers.
\item Security: Dedicated staff whose sole business is to care about security issues
\subitem (Is this true for all types of cloud services?)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Types of Cloud Services:\\ {\textbackslash}b[A-Z]A\{2\}S{\textbackslash}b}
\begin{itemize}
\item IAAS Infrastructure As A Service
\item PAAS Platform As A Service
\item SAAS Software As A Service
\item FAAS Framework As A Service
\item AAAS Application As A Service
\end{itemize}

Also:
\begin{itemize}
\item DAAS Datacenter As A Service (Private Clouds)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Some popular Cloud Providers}
\begin{itemize}
\item Amazon EC2 (IAAS)
\item DigitalOcean (IAAS)
\item Microsoft Azure (IAAS)
\item Microsoft OneDrive (PAAS?)
\item Microsoft Office Online (AAAS)
\item Google Drive (PAAS?)
\item Google Docs (AAAS)
\item Google App Engine (PAAS)
\item Rackspace (IAAS)
\item Gmail/Yahoo/Outlook (AAAS)
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Reasons for using the Cloud}
\begin{itemize}
\item Need more Capacity
\subitem Computing Power
\subitem Storage capacity
\subitem Burst-rate capacity
\subitem \ldots
\item Don't want to specialise on Server Maintenance
\subitem HW Repairs and Replacements
\subitem OS upgrades
\subitem Round-the-clock maintenance
\item Higher Reliability / Availability
\item Built-in and immediate Scalability (up as well as down)
\item Easier(?) Software Licensing
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}



\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Challenges when Developing Cloud Applications}
\begin{itemize}[<+->]
\item Understand your needs: What service level do you require (How many servers, for how long? How often?)
\item Understanding your quality requirements. Why are you going to the cloud?
\subitem Hint: It is often more than one quality requirement that is important.
\item Designing a scalable software architecture
\item Setting up automated deployment of your application
\item Setting up equivalent and automated development / test / stage / deployment envonments.
\item Setting up automated Provisioning and Orchestration
\item Defining your database needs, selecting the right database, and design a (cloud-) scalable database design.
\subitem Is it really possible to use a traditional RDBMS shared over several machines? What are your alternatives?
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Challenges when Developing Cloud Applications}

\begin{itemize}
\item Security! Despite all the fancy promises, if you opt for IAAS or PAAS, you need to take care of this yourself!
\item Security!! You also need to protect your application from other applications running on the same cloud provider.
\item Security!!! Design your application to Protect/encrypt your data when it is on the cloud.
\end{itemize}

Also:
\begin{itemize}
\item What is the value of existing infrastructure? How does this influence your cost/value calculations?
\item Are your software licenses ``cloud friendly''?
\item Are you aware of the legal, regulatory, and standards that are relevant for your application
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}


\begin{frame}[t]
\frametitle{Summary}
\begin{itemize}
\item There are several reasons for ``going cloud''
\item There are several different service levels offered
\item There is a unique set of development and management challenges when ``going cloud''
\end{itemize}

In this course:
\begin{itemize}
\item Lab 1 focus on getting the development infrastructure in place
\item The project focus on the design and implementation of your cloud application
\item Lab 2 goes behind the scenes and reveals one simple thing that the cloud providers need to do
\end{itemize}
