Notify the course manager that you have prepared your presentation. Be prepared to present it to the rest of the class. Be prepared to answer questions about your system, your architecture, or your deployment plan.

Optionally, you may prepare a screencast for your presentation. You will still need to be prepared to answer questions.

You shall also be prepared to start up your different deployment environments.
