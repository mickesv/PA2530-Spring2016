# Prerequisites
- You have [Selected a Project]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectBusinessCase/exp_selectproject.html) and briefly described it.

# Cloud Requirements
With your current (and initial) understanding of the problem, describe your perceived requirements in terms of:

- Number of required machines
- Computing power of machines
- Storage requirements
- Bandwidth requirements
- Domain name(s)
- Specific security requirements
- Specific privacy requirements

Give rough estimates on the baseline requirements and compare those to the burst requirements (e.g. during a major sales rush).

# Cost / Benefit Analysis
Make a rough estimate on what it would cost you to host the above on your own, and compare it with at least two cloud providers. Bear in mind that you can quickly add capacity to a cloud solution (provided you have designed your application well).

Consider the following items in particular:

- Capital Investment
- Setup costs
- Monthly service fees
- Monthly staff costs
- Net cost over first year
- Net cost over three years
- Net cost over five years
