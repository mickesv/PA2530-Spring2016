# Prerequisites
- You have [Selected a Project]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectBusinessCase/exp_selectproject.html) and briefly described it.

# Configuration Management System
- Select a configuration management system. To make life easier for us, we give you the choice between `git` or `subversion`.
- Create a repository
- Create an initial directory structure
- Invite the course responsible to the repository (read-only permission is sufficient).

Use this repository for your project.

- This makes it easy to distribute your code e.g. to your different development/test/deployment environments.
- If you would like to, you may connect the repository to e.g. [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/) for automated builds and tests.

  <div class="alert alert-info" role="alert"><b>Note</b>
  <p>We will use your activity on this repository as one indicator (among others) to help set your grade. If there is no activity, we will assume that you are not actively developing the project yourself, and will thus have to resort to other means for examining you.

If you wish to re-use a project that you have already done, please talk to us *beforehand* so we may assess your contribution to this project and whether it is sufficient to meet the learning outcomes of the course and assignment. We may ask you to complement your already-made project with additional information.
