# Select Project
Identify a project you wish to work on for this assignment. You may choose something from the list below, or you may develop something of your own.

Describe the project on *at most* one A4 page. Describe your interpretation of what the project is all about, and why you think it is a suitable cloud project to work on.


# Examples of Projects

## Craic
![Guinness]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectBusinessCase/FGuinness.jpg) James and Paddy were sitting once over a glass of Guinness and wanted to invent a neat way of telling their other friends what they were up to. They realised that a full scale blogging application was too much, especially since they wanted to use their mobile phones or their sturdy bash terminals to communicate. Thus, the idea of **Craic** was born as a microblogging application. In this application, each message is restricted to 250 characters and gets immediately posted on a user's timeline. One may *@mention* other users or create *#indexed* subjects that are searchable.

# HeartThat
![Heart]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectBusinessCase/Fheart.png) One disastrous evening Christer came up with the idea of a generic "like" application. The idea of this application, **HeartThat**, is that users are able to press a heart on a mobile application (or running the `heartBash` command line application), and each press is counted on a central server. The timestamp and region of origin for each heart press is used to count "votes" on a particular choice, for example a song that is playing on TV. Customers for HeartThat book the application for a particular region and period of time (for example, saturday evening between 20:00 and 21:30), and (most importantly) an estimate of the amount of hearts that are expected. By submitting a list of options with timestamps (e.g., "Song1;20:04;20:07"), the customer will get a corresponding list with the options and the number of hearts pressed within that timespan.

# STI -- Search for Terrestial Intelligence
![Marvin]({{site.baseurl}}/morea/ProjectBusinessCase/FMarvin.jpg) Doug decided that the best evidence for intelligent extra-terrestial life was that they have *not* tried to contact us. Instead, he decided to turn the analysis onto ourselves. The **STI** project consists of two parts. The first part is a Twitter Crawler. Given a seed user, it stores all that user's tweets, and then continues with that user's friends. The second part is the analysis part, where it looks for signs of intelligence in the tweets. Doug defines intelligence as:

> <small>Intelligence is the ability to reconcile totally contradictory situations without going completely bonkers -- for example, having a stomach ache and not having a stomach ache at the same time, holding a hole without the doughnut, having good luck and bad luck simultaneously, or seeing a real estate agent waive his fee.</small>

but you may use a different definition of intelligence, should you wish to.
