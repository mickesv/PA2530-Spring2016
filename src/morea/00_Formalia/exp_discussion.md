Join the [Course Discussion Board](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/pa2530) and, once your request to join has been approved, post a short introductory paragraph about yourself. This provides info to your fellow students, and also verifies that you have joined the discussion group and can post to it.

Configure the group settings to send messages posted to the group as an email to yourself.
