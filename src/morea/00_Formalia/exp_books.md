<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/morea/00_Formalia/Rosenberg.jpg" WIDTH="100" style="margin: 10px 10px"> J. Rosenberg, A. Mateos, <I>"The Cloud at your Service"</I>, Manning, 2010. ISBN-10: 1935182528 | ISBN-13: 978-1935182528<br>
A fairly ok all-purpose book. A bit management-heavy, but it is surprisingly difficult to find books about cloud computing that focus on the technical construction of a cloud application. Chapters 4 and onwards become more technical.

On a higher level; it does not go into detail in the same way about how you would design your software architecture, but does go through some of the technical challenges with a cloud solution. Also has some nice writeups of the motions you need to go through in order to get a virtual machine up and running on different cloud providers.

<img src="{{site.baseurl}}/morea/00_Formalia/Hofmeister.jpg" WIDTH="100" style="margin: 10px 10px"> C. Hofmeister et al., <I>"Applied Software Architecture"</I>, Addison-Wesley, 1999. ISBN-10: 0201325713 | ISBN-13: 978-0201325713<br>
A lot of designing a cloud application is simply about making conscious software architecture decisions, so any generic software architecture book would help here.

I still like this book even if it has a few years under the belt by now and may be difficult to get your hands on. The reason for this is that it is one of the few software architecture books I have seen that almost solely focus on the <I>architecture decisions</I>, and present a methodology that allows you to identify the need for architecture decisions, take the decisions, and implement the decisions in different viewpoints -- all while retaining traceability back to the source.

Also a general-purpose software architecture book. I find this book to be less hands on with a design methodology and more shoot-from-the-hip, but there is a large section on <I>architecture tactics</I>, i.e. solutions and structures that address different quality concerns. These are, I find, a great inspiration for the architectural decisions (and thus fits nicely in with Hofmeister et al).
