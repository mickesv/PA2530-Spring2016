Welcome to the homepage for the course PA2530 Cloud Computing, offered by Blekinge Institute of Technology.

We are currently working with creating the course. At the time of writing, most of the assignments are done and we will begin filling up with lectures shortly.

The first instance of the course will run during Spring 2016, so there's no hurry, right?
