<p>Introduces a tool for virtualisation (VirtualBox), and a layer on top of this tool that enables automation (Vagrant).</p>

<!--
Before deploying a cloud application, it is a good idea to first develop and test it locally. This can be done by first setting up a "private virtual cloud" (PVC for short), with all the machines you want, provisioned with the server software you need, and your application deployed on them.

In this module we introduce `VirtualBox` as one solution for creating your PVC.

Many virtualisation softwares, and VirtualBox in particular, has a graphical user interface. While this may be desirable in some cases, this makes it difficult to automate the creation of your PVC. Therefore, we also introduce `Vagrant`, which functions as a command-line based layer on top of VirtualBox.
