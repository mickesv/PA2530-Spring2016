  <h1 id="cloud-topic-investigation">Cloud Topic Investigation</h1>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Select a topic and communicate this to the course manager.</p>

    <p>Find a cloud related topic of your interest. You may pick one from the list of suggested topics below, or you may create your own topic. If you create your own topic, there are guidelines below for what your investigation must include.</p>

    <p>When you communicate your selected topic to the course manager, include the following information:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Your Name and E-mail address</li>
      <li>A tentative title of your report</li>
      <li>Planned start date, planned end date</li>
      <li>A brief description of what you intend to do</li>
      <li>A rough outline of your “plan of attack”</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The course manager may tell you to revise your selected topic or your methodology.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Conduct your investigation.</p>

    <p>Conduct your investigation, while adhering to the investigation guidelines below.</p>

    <p>If you run tests or evaluate different tools or techniques, remember to maintain a log of your actions and their results.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Write report.</p>

    <p>Write a report that summarises your finding. This report shall <em>at least</em> contain the following:</p>

    <ol>
      <li><strong>Introduction</strong> –  Introducing your topic, and why it is important from the perspective of cloud computing.</li>
      <li><strong>Background</strong> – Describing research and/or background material that a reader need to grasp in order to understand what you have done.</li>
      <li><strong>Related Work</strong> – What have other researchers done that is similar to what you have done?</li>
      <li><strong>Methodology</strong> – What do you intend to study, how do you intend to study it?</li>
      <li><strong>Results</strong> – What did you find?</li>
      <li><strong>Discussion</strong> – What do your results mean? How do they relate to what other researchers have done? What recommendations can you make to others?</li>
      <li><strong>Conclusions</strong> – Summarise your findings and connect back to your motivation of importance in the introduction.</li>
      <li><strong>Appendices</strong> – Containing whatever logs or material you think may be helpful but not necessary to understand your study and your findings.</li>
    </ol>

    <p><strong>Size.</strong> We do not expect a master’s thesis. 5-10 pages is enough, although we do not put any page limits in either direction. Bear in mind, though, that even a seasoned professor would have a hard time to fit a meaningful investigation into less than 4-5 pages.</p>

    <p><strong>References.</strong> 6-10 references to scientific publications is enough to support your work.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<h1 id="investigation-guidelines">Investigation Guidelines</h1>
<p>These guidelines apply both if you have selected a topic from the list below, or if you have created your own topic.</p>

<p>Your investigation <em>must</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be fun and interesting to you</li>
  <li>Enable you to dig deeper into a cloud topic</li>
  <li>Allow you to compare what you learn with what others have learnt</li>
  <li>Result in some concrete guidelines for other practitioners that wish to learn more about cloud computing</li>
  <li>Have a technical aspect to it</li>
</ul>

<p>Your investigation <em>may</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be a thorough investigation of a particular problem (with solution suggestions)</li>
  <li>Be an in-depth comparison between different solutions to a particular problem</li>
  <li>Either be more technical or more scientific in nature.</li>
</ul>

<p>Your investigation <em>must not</em>:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Be a regurgitation of what others have said</li>
  <li>Be trivial</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="topics-suggestions">Topics Suggestions</h1>

<h2 id="a-comparison-of-different-hypervisors">A Comparison of Different Hypervisors</h2>
<p>Pick at least three hypervisors and compare them. What are the benefits and liabilities of each hypervisor? How would you use them to set up a data center where you can serve any number of virtual machines to your users? What options are available to script the startup and shutdown of machines, to avoid using a GUI?</p>

<h2 id="a-comparison-of-configuration-management-tools">A Comparison of Configuration Management Tools</h2>
<p>Pick at least two configuration management tools/provisioning tools that you have not used yet. Compare them with the one you used for your project, and configure your project to use at least one of them.</p>

<p>Investigate their capabilities and limitations. What can you do with each tool, what can you not do? How do you use them to maintain and monitor a large cloud solution?</p>

<h2 id="a-comparison-of-different-cloud-providers">A Comparison of Different Cloud Providers</h2>
<p>Pick at least three cloud providers and compare them. What services do each provider offer? What service levels, in terms of reliability, availability, scalability, security, and privacy, do they offer? What types of machines do they offer? At what prices?</p>

<p>Create a set of at least five scenarios for using a cloud solution. Describe each briefly and then assess each of your investigated cloud providers’ ability to satisfy your scenario, and at what total cost of “ownership”.</p>

<h2 id="an-investigation-of-cloud-database-design-solutions">An investigation of Cloud Database Design Solutions</h2>
<p>Explore how you design databases to provide the best cloud solution. Factor in aspects such as reliability, availability, scalability, security, and privacy.</p>

<h2 id="cloudfront-solutions">CloudFront Solutions</h2>
<p>Explore how you can design and deploy your application such that it is always being served from the datacenter which is closest to the user. Some cloud providers have tool support for this; explore these tools. How would you deal with roaming users?</p>
